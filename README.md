# Reference Evapotranspiration Calculation Code Examples for Matlab and Octave
In this repository, there are some Matlab/Octave functions to calculate reference evapotranspirations.

This is a work in progress, so some examples will be added later on.

Available methods are:
- Penman-Monteith (FAO56) Method
- Hargreaves-Samani Method
- Thornthwaite Method
